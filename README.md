# Neural Blind Source Separation and Diarization for Distant Speech Recognition
This is a repository of neural full-rank spatial covariance analysis with speaker activity (neural FCASA).
Neural FCASA is a method for jointly separating and diarizing speech mixtures without supervision by isolated signals.


## Installation
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/b-sigpro/neural-fcasa.git
```

## Inference
### Using model pre-trained on the AMI corpus
```bash
python -m neural_fcasa.dereverberate input.wav input_derev.wav
python -m neural_fcasa.separate one hf://b-sigpro/neural-fcasa input_derev.wav output.wav
```

### General usage
#### Dereverberation
```bash
python -m neural_fcasa.dereverberate input.wav output.wav
```

This is just a thin wrapper of `nara_wpe`.
The options are as follows:
* `--n_fft`: Window length of STFT (default=512)
* `--hop_length` Hop length of STFT (default=160)
* `--taps` Tap length of WPE (default=10)
* `--delay` Delay of WPE (default=3)


#### Separation and diarization
```bash
python -m neural_fcasa.separate one /path/to/model/ input.wav output.wav
```

The options are as follows:
* `--thresh`: Threshold to obtain diarization result (default: 0.5)
* `--out_ch`: Output channel index for Wiener filtering (default: 0)
* `--medfilt_size`: Filter size of median postfiltering (default: 11)
* `--dump_diar`: Dump diarization results as a pickle file (default: `false`)
* `--noi_snr`: SNR for white noise added to the separated result. No noise is added with `None`. (default: `None`)
* `--normalize`: Perform normalization of the separated result (default: `false`)
* `--device`: device type (e.g., `cuda` and `cpu`) for inference. (default: `cuda`)

We used the following configuration for the evaluation in the paper:
```bash
python -m neural_fcasa.separate one hf://b-sigpro/neural-fcasa --dump_diar --noi_snr=40 --normalize input.wav output.wav
```


### Limitations
The current inference script has the following limitations, which we are addressing to solve:
* [ ] The # mics. must be the same as that at the training (8).
* [ ] The input length must be less than 50 seconds due to the max. length of the positional encoding (5000).
* [ ] The performance will be maximized by making the input length the same as that at the training (10 seconds).

## Training
The training script is compatible with PyTorch Lightning >= 2.2.3. The training dependencies will be installed by
```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

The training job script for [AI Bridging Cloud Infrastructure (ABCI)](https://abci.ai/) is attached on [`recipes/ami/`](https://github.com/b-sigpro/neural-fcasa/tree/main/recipes/neural-fcasa).

0. Prepare a singularity container and place it as `recipes/singularity/singularity.sif`

1. Move to the recipe directory
    ```bash
    cd recipes/ami/
    ```

2. Download the ami corpus and its metadata and configure `dataset_path` and `metadata_path` in `scripts/config.yaml`

3. Split audio files with the following command and with the submitted job to finish:
    ```bash
    ./scripts/1_split_data.py sub
    ```

4. Split speaker activities:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/2_split_activations.py sub
  ```

5. Dereverberate audio files
  ```bash
  ./scripts/3_dereverberate.py sub
  ```

6. Make HDF5
  ```bash
  ./scripts/4_make_dataset_chunk.py sub
  ```
  Please make sure that you are using h5py capable of parallel HDF5

7. Submit training job
  ```bash
  ./models/neural-fcasa/train.sh -q
  ```
